Issue: Incorrect University Name on Front Page

**Description:**

While exploring the GDSC ITM website, I noticed that on the front page, the name of another university is incorrectly displayed instead of our institute's name (Institute of Technology and Management).

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Visit the website at https://gdscitm.netlify.app/
2. Scroll  to the front page.

**Expected Behavior:**

The front page right side image should prominently display  as the university name.

**Actual Behavior:**

The front page displays "Another University" instead of "GDSC ITM

**Additional Information:**

This issue affects the overall presentation of our club and should be corrected as soon as possible.
